# SVM-Classification-algo
The goal of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the different classes.
Optimal Hyperplane: Among the many possible hyperplanes, SVM tries to find the one that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The margin is defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class
